# PROJECT 1-  Polythene Shrinking Machine

## Problem
Plastic and polythene waste poses a major environmental threat due to its large volume and slow decomposition.

## Solution
I designed a machine that shrinks polythene waste into a compact ball-like form, reducing volume significantly. The compressed material can be reused for applications such as road construction and infrastructure reinforcement.

## Impact
- Significant reduction in plastic volume
- Promotes recycling and sustainable waste management

## Recognition
- Project proposed at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)
- Awarded cash prizes at events in Mumbai and Delhi

  # Skills Used
- Arduino
- Mechanical design
- Environmental engineering concepts
- Problem-solving & innovation

## Problem
Accidents in hilly and mountainous regions like Kashmir often occur due to poor visibility, sharp turns, and lack of warning systems.

## Solution
I developed a sensor-based system using Arduino and coding to detect potential accident conditions and provide alerts, helping reduce risks in hilly terrain.

## Applications
- Road safety in mountainous regions
- Early warning systems for drivers

## Recognition
- Presented at multiple exhibitions including Indore
- Won awards and recognition for innovation and social impact
- got recognised by India's top newspaper and got my name on it 
## Skills Used
- Arduino
- Sensors & embedded systems
- Python programming
- Safety system design
