# PROJECT 1-  Polythene Shrinking Machine

## Problem
Plastic and polythene waste poses a major environmental threat due to its large volume and slow decomposition.

## Solution
I designed a machine that shrinks polythene waste into a compact ball-like form, reducing volume significantly. The compressed material can be reused for applications such as road construction and infrastructure reinforcement.

## Impact
- Significant reduction in plastic volume
- Promotes recycling and sustainable waste management

## Recognition
- Project proposed at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)
- Awarded cash prizes at events in Mumbai and Delhi

## Problem
Accidents in hilly and mountainous regions like Kashmir often occur due to poor visibility, sharp turns, and lack of warning systems.

## Solution
I developed a sensor-based system using Arduino and coding to detect potential accident conditions and provide alerts, helping reduce risks in hilly terrain.

## Applications
- Road safety in mountainous regions
- Early warning systems for drivers

 # Gas Leak & Earthquake Early Warning Alert System
# Project Overview

This project is a sensor-based safety system designed to detect domestic gas leaks and seismic vibrations in households to prevent accidents, explosions, and structural damage.

The system uses gas detection and vibration sensors integrated with an Arduino microcontroller to provide early alerts through visual and audio indicators, allowing occupants to take immediate preventive action.

The goal of the project is to enhance household safety, particularly in regions where gas leaks and earthquake-related incidents pose significant risks.

# Problem Statement

Gas leaks in Indian households often lead to fires and explosions due to delayed detection.

Many regions are prone to mild seismic activities, where early vibration detection could reduce injury and panic.

Affordable early-warning systems are not widely accessible at the household level.

This project aims to provide a low-cost, scalable safety solution.

# Objectives

Detect gas leaks before dangerous concentration levels are reached.

Provide early warning for unusual vibration activity.

Create an affordable and easily replicable safety system.

Increase awareness about preventive household safety technologies.

# Potential Impact

Reduces risk of domestic gas explosions.

Encourages preventive disaster preparedness.

Can be further upgraded with:

GSM module for SMS alerts

Automatic gas valve shutoff system

IoT-based remote monitoring
